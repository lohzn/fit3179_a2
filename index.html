        <h2>Japan’s Earthquakes: Where and How Big?</h2>
        <p>
          This symbol map shows the location and magnitude of significant
          earthquakes (greater than 4 on the Richter scale) that occurred in
          Japan from 2016 to 2018. The size of the circle represents the
          magnitude of the earthquake, while the color represents the depth of
          the earthquake. The darker the color, the deeper the earthquake. We
          can see that most of the earthquakes are concentrated along the
          coastlines of Japan, especially in the south and east regions. This is
          because Japan is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where several
          tectonic plates meet and cause frequent seismic activity.

          <h2>Japan’s Monthly Earthquake Frequency: When and How Many?</h2>
          <p>
            This bar chart shows the number of significant earthquakes that
            occurred in each month combined from 2016 to 2018. We can see that
            there is no clear seasonal pattern in the frequency of earthquakes,
            as they occur randomly throughout the year. However, we can notice
            some peaks and troughs in certain months. For example, September had
            the highest number of earthquakes (201), followed by November (158)
            and April (157). These months correspond to some major earthquakes
            that hit Japan, such as the Tomakomai earthquake in April 2018 and
            theHokkaido earthquake in September 2018.

          <h2>Japan’s Yearly Earthquake Frequency: A Colorful Perspective</h2>
          <p>
            This heatmap shows another way of visualizing the frequency of
            significant earthquakes in each month from 2016 to 2018. The color
            intensity represents the number of earthquakes, with darker colors
            indicating higher numbers. We can see that this visualization
            confirms what we observed in the bar chart, that there is no clear
            seasonal pattern in the frequency of earthquakes, but there are some
            months with higher or lower numbers of earthquakes. We can also
            compare the frequency of earthquakes across different years by
            looking at the rows of the heatmap.

        <h2>Japan’s Earthquake Depth vs Magnitude: How Deep and How Strong?</h2>
        <p>
          This line chart above shows the relationship between the depth and magnitude
          of significant earthquakes <span style="color: navy">2016</span>,
          <span style="color: orange">2017</span> and
          <span style="color: red">2018</span>. The x-axis represents the depth
          of the earthquake, while the y-axis represents the magnitude of the
          earthquake. The color of the line represents the year of the
          earthquake. We can see that there is a negative correlation between
          the depth and magnitude of earthquakes, but again it is not very
          dicernable, meaning that the deeper the earthquake, the lower the
          magnitude. This is because deeper earthquakes release less energy than
          shallow earthquakes, as they have to travel through more layers of
          rock before reaching the surface. Moreover, we can see that there is a
          lot of congestion towards lower depths, indicating that many
          earthquakes are closer to the mainland. This implies that they are
          more dangerous and civilians need to be alert and prepared for
          potential disasters.
